# e-Ration Shop â€” Prototype (Rails skeleton)
This is a **minimal Rails project skeleton** for the *e-Ration Shop* prototype you requested.
It contains essential files (models, controllers, migrations, views and config) so you can finish, run and deploy the app.

## Important notes
- This is a simplified skeleton. You still need Ruby, Rails and PostgreSQL installed.
- After downloading, run:
```bash
cd e-ration-shop-prototype
gem install bundler
bundle install
rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
rails server
```
- The project uses Devise, PostgreSQL, and ActiveStorage (you may need to run additional setup).
- Replace simulated Aadhaar/payment/OTP code with production integrations before deploying.

## Files included
- Gemfile, docker-compose.yml
- app/ (models, controllers, views)
- config/ routes and database config
- db/migrate/ sample migrations
- db/seeds.rb
- README with run instructions

Good luck! If you'd like, I can now expand any specific feature into full, production-ready code (Aadhaar flow, payments, maps).
